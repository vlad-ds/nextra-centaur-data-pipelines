# Parallel Pipelines

Parallel pipelines process multiple data streams or chunks simultaneously, significantly improving throughput and efficiency for large-scale data processing.

## Types of Parallelism

### 1. Data Parallelism
```sql
-- BigQuery example of data parallelism
SELECT 
  *,
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() as processed_at
FROM `project.dataset.large_table`
WHERE MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(id)), 10) = @partition_id
```

### 2. Task Parallelism
- Independent transformations run simultaneously
- No data dependencies between parallel branches
- Joins happen at consolidation points

## Implementation Strategies

### Partitioning Approaches
1. Range Partitioning
2. Hash Partitioning
3. Time-based Partitioning

### BigQuery-Specific Features
- Automatic query parallelization
- Slot management
- Concurrent query optimization

## Monitoring and Optimization

- Track slot utilization
- Monitor execution plans
- Optimize partition strategies
- Balance resource allocation
