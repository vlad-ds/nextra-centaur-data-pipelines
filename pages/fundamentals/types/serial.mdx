# Serial Pipelines

Serial pipelines process data in a sequential manner, where each step depends on the completion of previous steps. This architecture is common in scenarios where data transformations must occur in a specific order.

## Characteristics

- Sequential execution of tasks
- Strong dependencies between steps
- Predictable data flow
- Simple to understand and debug

## Implementation Pattern

```sql
-- Example of serial processing in BigQuery
WITH raw_data AS (
  SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.source_table`
),
transformed_data AS (
  SELECT 
    id,
    UPPER(name) as name,
    processed_at
  FROM raw_data
),
final_output AS (
  SELECT 
    *,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() as pipeline_timestamp
  FROM transformed_data
)
SELECT * FROM final_output
```

## Best Practices

1. Implement checkpointing
2. Use transaction boundaries
3. Design for failure recovery
4. Monitor step completion times
